    <p>A <b>viola</b> is a stringed instrument within the <em>violin</em> family. It is often difficult to distinguish from a violin because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the viola is played the same way as a violin</li>
      <li>the viola's low-end is only about 5 notes lower than a violin</li>
      <li>the viola's tone is very similar to that of a violin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The viola is in the <em>alto</em> range, while the violin is more <em>soprano</em>, meaning that the violin produces a higher, clearer sound than the viola. Also, the viola plays more of a supporting role than a solo role: it is used to fill in the middle ranges in any ensemble. For this reason, and because it has a more mellow sound, the viola often goes unnoticed.</p>
    <p>The viola is said to sound more like a human voice than any other instrument. The tone of a viola is more 'sultry' than a violin. <a target="_blank" href="https://vsl.co.at/en/Viola/Sound_Characteristics">This article</a> describes the sound of each string of the viola, and has audio samples in sidebar.</p>
    <p>Have you ever 'played' an elastic band, and noticed how you can produce different notes based on how tightly you pull it?  The exact same science happens with the strings of any instrument! Strings in the violin family are not elastic, however, but usually made of steel, synthetic nylon, or even catgut! Despite its name, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgut">catgut is not actually from cats</a>.</p>
    <p>Since any string only plays a single sound (without being altered), a violin's size is determined by its <span class="length">string length</span>, often about 327 mm (12.8 in). However, violas are measured by <span class="length">body length</span>, usually between 30-43 cm (12-17 in).  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/09/how-guitars-sound-so-sweet.html">Here is a brief article</a> on sound vibrations, and <a target="_blank" href="http://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/strings.html">here is a more in-depth look</a> into the science of strings, waves, and harmonics.</p>
